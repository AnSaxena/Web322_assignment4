          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Currently I am a Computer Programming student at Seneca College, Canada. Basically, I am from the county of flavours, colors, festivals, numerous languages and culture live together with peace , yes I am from INDIA . I completed my high school in year 2021 with Mathematics ,Physics and Chemistry which was pretty cool and interesting.</p>
          <p>I am professionally a Classical dancer and can perform various other dance styles , I trained in Classical dance for 15 years as I started when i was 3years old. I performed all over my country and it all was a nice and challenging experience to meet people from different background and perform with them.  </p>
          <p>Not only this I am also a motivational speaker and MUN speaker. When I talk about public speaking ,I always remember that being a speaker was not an easy journey for me or may be the most challenging as I was always shy a around public but my constant hardwork and consistency and several stage performance made me the famous speaker in my State and that made me to meet the Prime Minister of my country INDIA.  </p>
          <p>All all these other passions I stated my career as a student of Computer Programming as computer and apps always facinates me and being curious from early age suggests me be a web developer in future. My main motive to lear this amazing course is to help my country with new technology and provide them knowledge regarding the upcoming innovations.  </p>
